You can either save or export your projects. Saving a project will create a [.pxo file](../concepts/project/#pxo-files), which is Pixelorama's custom file format, while exporting means that one (or multiple, in case of animations) `.png`(s) or a `.gif` file(s) will be created. 

:::tip saving vs exporting
Basically, you should **save** your project if you intent to use it again on Pixelorama and keep all of your data, such as layers, [project brushes](../concepts/brush/#project-brushes), animation tags, etc. While, if you want to share your artwork or want to have the ability to view it on an image editor, you should **export** it. Of course, nothing is stopping you from doing both, which is actually the recommended approach.

## Saving
To save a project, you can go to the File menu and select Save, or press <kbd>Control + S</kbd>. If you are using a Desktop version, you will be able to choose where you want the file to be saved. If you use the Web version, you will be asked for a file name and the `.pxo` file will be downloaded by your browser.
